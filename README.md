# Simple Client

This is a React gallery frontend that can consume our API which has been created with Django Rest Framework.

You need to have Node install in order to run this project

### Setup

```
- clone the repo
- install the node version v12.22.7
- run the command in the root directory of the project "npm install"
- run the command "npm start" to start the project
- http://localhost:3000/
```

Note: As it is a pure React JS project it might even work without the backend running. However, you need to run the backend first to be able to fully see all the functionalities.
